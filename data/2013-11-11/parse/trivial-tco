 "A library to assist in ensuring certain code is executed with tail call optimizations enabled."
 :LONG-DESCRIPTION "# trivial-tco

A Common Lisp library to assist in ensuring certain code is executed with tail
call optimizations enabled.

## Installation

```
cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
git clone https://github.com/rmoritz/trivial-tco
```

## Usage

```common-lisp
(ql:quickload :trivial-tco)

(tco:with-tail-call-optimization ()
  (labels ((sum-aux (acc x)
             (if (zerop x)
                 acc
                 (sum-aux (+ acc x) (- x 1))))
           (sum (n)
             (sum-aux 0 n)))
    (sum 1000000)))
```

## Status

There is a small test suite that can be executed via `(ql:quickload
:trivial-tco-test)` or `(asdf:test-system :trivial-tco)`. I've only run it on
[CCL](http://ccl.clozure.com).
