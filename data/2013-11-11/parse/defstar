   "* Description

DEFSTAR is a collection of macros that can be used in place of =DEFUN,
DEFMETHOD, DEFGENERIC, DEFVAR, DEFPARAMETER, FLET, =LABELS=, =LET*= and =LAMBDA=.
Each macro has the same name as the form it replaces, with a star added at the
end, e.g. =DEFUN*=. (The exception is the =LET*= replacement, which is called
=*LET=).

The macros allow:
- easy inclusion of type declarations within lambda lists
- easy inclusion of return type declarations in function and method definitions
- easy declaration of variables as 'ignored', by the use of '_' as a placeholder
  in argument lists.
- easy inclusion of assertions for each argument and for the function's
  return value, thus allowing simple programming by contract.

See [[defun*]] and [[defvar*]] for a detailed description of syntax. See also
the examples below.

DEFSTAR's home is at:
- [[http://bitbucket.org/eeeickythump/defstar/]]

Installation requires [[http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/][ASDF]]. DEFSTAR
does not depend on any other libraries.

* Examples of DEFUN* and DEFMETHOD* usage
;;; ;; Define a simple function that adds two numbers, both of which
;;; ;; are declared to be real.
;;; (defun* sum ((a real) (b real))
;;;    (+ a b))
;;;
;;; ;; Now also declare that the function returns a real.
;;; (defun* (sum -> real) ((a real) (b real))
;;;    (+ a b))
;;;
;;; ;; Another way of declaring the function's return type.
;;; (defun* sum ((a real) (b real))
;;;    (:returns real)
;;;    (+ a b))
;;;
;;; ;; We want to ensure that a and b are never negative.
;;; ;; One way is to alter the type declarations:
;;; (defun* (sum -> (real 0)) ((a (real 0)) (b (real 0)))
;;;    (+ a b))
;;;
;;; ;; Another way is to define a new type:
;;; (deftype natural () '(real 0))
;;; (defun* (sum -> natural) ((a natural) (b natural))
;;;    (+ a b))
;;;
;;; ;; Another way is to use assertions:
;;; (defun* (sum -> real (>= result 0)) ((a real (>= a 0)) (b real (>= b 0)))
;;;    (+ a b))
;;;
;;; ;; Or:
;;; (defun* sum ((a real (>= a 0)) (b real (>= b 0)))
;;;    (:returns real (>= result 0))
;;;    (+ a b))
;;;
;;; ;; Or, using the feature that the names of single-argument predicate
;;; ;; functions can be used as assertions:
;;; (defun* (naturalp -> boolean) ((x real))
;;;    (not (minusp x)))
;;; ...
;;; (defun* (sum -> real naturalp) ((a real naturalp) (b real naturalp))
;;;    (+ a b))
;;;
;;; ;; Another approach is to use :pre and :post clauses. Each contains one
;;; ;; more forms, ALL of which must evaluate to non-nil. Within :post
;;; ;; forms, result is bound to the value that the function or form
;;; ;; is about to return.
;;; (defun* (sum -> real) ((a real) (b real))
;;;    (:pre (>= a 0) (>= b 0))
;;;    (:post (>= result 0))
;;;    (+ a b))
;;;
;;; ;; A function that returns multiple values.
;;; (defun* (floor -> (values integer integer)) ((n real) (d real))
;;;    (cl:floor n d))
;;;
;;; ;; Example of ignoring arguments
;;; (*let (((top . _) list))
;;;    (print top))
;;;
;;; ;; It is possible to use assertions with functions that return
;;; ;; multiple values. When a function is declared to return multiple
;;; ;; values, RESULT will be bound to a LIST of those values.
;;; (defun* floor ((n real) (d real))
;;;    (:returns (values integer integer)
;;;             (< (second result) (first result)))
;;;    (cl:floor n d))
;;;
;;; ;; To declare that a function returns an unspecified number of
;;; ;; values, of unspecified types:
;;; (defun* (floor -> (values)) ((n real) (d real))
;;;    ...)
;;;
;;; ;; The type of a &REST argument can be declared. The declaration
;;; ;; refers to the types of each element in the list of arguments
;;; ;; stored in the &REST argument.
;;; (defun* (+ -> real) (&rest (numbers real))
;;;    (apply #'cl:+ numbers))
;;;
;;; ;; More complicated lambda list.
;;; ;; Note that the function and its first argument do not have type
;;; ;; declarations.
;;; ;; Also note the syntax of typed keyword arguments:
;;; ;; ((var TYPE [ASSERTION]) DEFAULT [SUPPLIEDP])
;;; ;; Note that &OPTIONAL arguments use the same syntax.
;;; (defun* my-find (item (seq sequence) &key (from-end boolean)
;;;                  ((test (or null (function (t)))) nil)
;;;                  ((test-not (or null (function (t)))) nil)
;;;                  ((key (or null (function (t)))) nil)
;;;                  (start fixnum) (end fixnum))
;;;    ...function body...)
;;;
;;; ;; Example of method definition. All the arguments in the arglist are
;;; ;; normal 'specialised' arguments like you would usually find in a
;;; ;; method definition. The form still allows you to include an assertion
;;; ;; with each argument, however ('plusp' in this case).
;;; (defmethod* (cell-value -> real) :around ((sheet <Sheet>)
;;;                                           (x integer plusp) (y integer plusp))
;;;    ...)
;;;
;;; ;; Note that when you declare a return type for a method, the method
;;; ;; body will perform type-checking, but no toplevel DECLAIM form will
;;; ;; be generated.
;;;
;;; ;; CLOS function dispatch based on classes is limited; you cannot specialise
;;; ;; on user-defined types unless they are proper classes, for example.
;;; ;; You may therefore sometimes want to declare that a method's argument
;;; ;; is of a particular type, as well as declaring its class for specialisation
;;; ;; as you normally would.
;;; ;; Here is an example. Note the similarity to the syntax for keyword
;;; ;; arguments.
;;; (defmethod* (cell-value -> real) :around ((sheet <Sheet>)
;;;                                           ((x natural plusp) integer)
;;;                                           ((y natural plusp) integer))
;;;    ...)
;;;
;;; ;; Example of DEFGENERIC*, mainly useful to declare the return type
;;; ;; of a set of methods. Note the documentation string can appear after
;;; ;; the argument list, similar to DEFUN.
;;; (defgeneric* (cell-value -> real) (sheet x y)
;;;   \"Return the value of the cell at coordinates X,Y in SHEET.\")
;;;
;;; ;; DEFGENERIC* can also be used to declare types of arguments. Be careful
;;; ;; that these don't clash with specialisers in method definitions.
;;; (defgeneric* (cell-value -> real) (sheet (x natural) (y natural)))

* Examples of DEFVAR* and DEFPARAMETER* usage

;;; (defvar* (*user-name* string) \"Bob\")
;;; (defparameter* (*file-position* (integer 0)) 0)

* Type DECLARATION versus type CHECKING

Technically, =DECLARE=, =DECLAIM= and the like do not actually check that
values stored in the associated variables conform to the declared type.
They merely constitute a promise /by the programmer/ that only values of
the specified type will be stored there. The consequences of storing
a string in a variable that is declared to be of type integer, are
technically 'undefined'.

In practice, most modern Common Lisp implementations perform type-checking
based on declaration information, especially when the =SAFETY= setting is high.

DEFSTAR allows you to force lisp to perform type checking based on
declarations. If you set the global variable
[[*check-argument-types-explicitly?*]] to non-nil, =CHECK-TYPE= forms will
included in the body of each function or method, causing an error to be raised
if a value does not match its declared type.

* Limitations

- Definitions of =SETF= methods cannot include return type declarations in the
  method 'header'. The return type can still be declared using a =(:RETURNS ...)=
  form. For example:
;;; (defmethod (setf (foo -> integer)) (...args...)   ; illegal
;;;    ...)
;;;
;;; (defmethod (setf foo) (...args...)
;;;    (:returns integer)                  ; legal
;;;    ...)

* Syntax highlighting of DEFSTAR macros in Emacs

Put the following code in your =.emacs= if you want =DEFVAR*= and other
forms to appear in the same face as their normal counterparts, and if
you want their docstrings to also be correctly identified as docstrings
rather than normal strings.

;;; ;; fontify doc strings in correct face
;;; ;; lisp-mode already fontifies 'defun*' correctly
;;; (put 'defvar*   'doc-string-elt 3)
;;; (put 'defparameter*   'doc-string-elt 3)
;;; (put 'lambda*   'doc-string-elt 2)
;;;
;;; (defvar *lisp-special-forms*
;;;       (regexp-opt '(\"defvar*\"
;;;                     \"defconstant*\"
;;;                     \"defparameter*\"
;;;                     \"defgeneric*\"
;;;                     \"defmethod*\"
;;;                     \"lambda*\"
;;;                     \"flet*\"
;;;                     \"labels*\") 'words))
;;; (font-lock-add-keywords 'lisp-mode
;;;  `((,*lisp-special-forms* . font-lock-keyword-face)))

- FNAME :: either the name of the function to be created, or a list with the
  following grammar:
  : fname =   FUNCTION-NAME
  :         | (FUNCTION-NAME -> TYPE [assertion])
  : assertion =       FORM
  :                 | PREDICATE-SYMBOL
  Where:
  - =TYPE= is any valid type specifier
  - =FORM= is any form, which must return non-nil if the assertion is satisfied,
    nil otherwise. Within the form, the symbol =RESULT= is bound to the
    value that is about to be returned by the function.
  - =PREDICATE-SYMBOL= is a symbol, the name of a function that accepts a single
    argument. Equivalent to the form =(PREDICATE-SYMBOL RESULT)=.

    /Note:/ if the latter (list) form for fname is used, the =DEFUN*= body may
    /not/ also contain a =:returns= form. Also note that the latter form cannot
    currently be used when defining a =(setf ...)= function or method.
- ARGLIST :: a =DEFUN*= LAMBDA LIST, which uses the following grammar:
  : arglist =   var-term*
  :           | (var-term* [&optional opt-term+])
  :           | (var-term* [&key opt-term+])

  : opt-term =        VARNAME
  :                 | (var-term DEFAULT [SUPPLIEDP])
  Where:
  - =VARNAME= is a symbol that will name the variable bound to the function
    argument.
  - =TYPE/CLASS= and =ELEMENT-TYPE= are forms that are legal type
    declarations. For example, the name of a simple type or class, or a list if
    the type declaration is more complex.
  - =DEFAULT= and =SUPPLIED-P= are the default value, and a variable that will
    indicate whether the argument was supplied.
- BODY :: Body of the function form. This may contain a docstring in the usual
  place, and may also contain:
  - a single special form beginning with =:returns=:
    : returns-form = (:RETURNS TYPE [assertion])
    If the =:returns= form contains an assertion, then within that assertion,
    the symbol =RESULT= is bound to the value that the function is
    about to return.
  - a single special form beginning with =:pre= followed by one or more
    expressions, which will be evaluated before any other code in the body.
    All of the expressions must evaluate to non-nil, or an error is signalled.
    : pre-form = (:PRE [assertion] [assertion]*)
  - a single special form beginning with =:post= followed by one or more
    expressions, which will be evaluated just prior to the function returning.
    All of the expressions must evaluate to non-nil, or an error is signalled.
    Within the :post clause, =result= is bound to the return value of the
    function.
    : post-form = (:POST [assertion] [assertion]*)

* Description
Equivalent to =(DEFUN fname arglist . body)=, but:
- All type declarations within the lambda list will be turned into =(DECLARE...)=
  forms within the function body
- If a return type is declared for the function itself, this will be turned
  into a global =DECLAIM= form that immediately precedes the function.
- Any variables whose names are '_' are renamed with unique symbols
  and declared 'ignored' within the function body. This provides a quick way
  to ignore arguments or parts of arguments.
- All assertions within the lambda list or =:pre= form will be checked before
  the function body is entered.
- Any assertions within a =:returns= form or =:post= form will be checked
  before the function returns a value.

* Examples
;;; ;; Very simple example
;;; (defun* (add -> real) ((a real) (b real))
;;;   (+ a b))

;;; ;; Example with assertion for 'b' argument, checked before the
;;; ;; body of the function is entered.
;;; (defun* div ((a real) (b real (/= b 0)))
;;;    (:returns real)
;;;    (/ a b))

;;; ;; Similar to above example but using :pre clause.
;;; (defun* div ((a real) (b real))
;;;    (:returns real)
;;;    (:pre (/= b 0))
;;;    (/ a b))

;;; (defun* sum (&rest (nums real))  ; type of 'rest' var refers to
;;;    (:returns real)                ; the type of each list element, ie
;;;    (apply #'+ nums))             ; nums must be a list of REALs

;;; (defun* (sum -> real) (&rest (nums real))  ; alternative form
;;;    (apply #'+ nums))                       ; for above example

;;; ;; This function and first argument have no type declarations.
;;; ;; Keyword argument 'test' accepts a function that takes
;;; ;; two arguments of any type.
;;; (defun* find-in-tree (item (tree cons)
;;;                       &key ((test (function (t t))) #'equal))
;;;  (or (funcall test item tree)
;;;      (and (consp tree)
;;;           (or (find-in-tree item (car tree))
;;;               (find-in-tree item (cdr tree))))))

     :DOCUMENTATION "* Arguments

Usage is exactly the same as [[defun*]], except that within =METHOD-ARGLIST=,
any list in a non-optional position (prior to any =&key, &rest,= or =&optional=
keyword) is assumed to be a specialised lambda list term of the form =(VARNAME
CLASS [assertion])=, rather than a DEFUN* type-declaring term.

The syntax of METHOD-ARGLIST is therefore:
: arglist-and-qualifiers =   [qualifier]* method-arglist
: qualifier =  :in-layer LAYER
:            | :in LAYER
:            | :around
:            | :before
:            | :after  (etc)
: method-arglist = method-term*
:           | (method-term* [&optional opt-term+])
:           | (method-term* [&key opt-term+])
:           | (method-term* [&rest rest-term])
: method-term = VARNAME
:               | (VARNAME CLASS [assertion])
:               | ((VARNAME TYPE/CLASS [assertion]) CLASS)
The rest of the syntax is the same as for DEFUN*.

If the :in or :in-layer qualifier is present (they are synonymous), this
form will generate a ContextL `define-layered-method' form rather than a
`defmethod'.

* Description
Equivalent to =(DEFMETHOD FNAME METHOD-ARGLIST . body)= with type declarations
and assertions as per [[defun*]].

* Examples
;;; (deftype positive-integer () `(integer 1))
;;;
;;; (defmethod (make-coords -> (cons positive-integer positive-integer))
;;;                (((x positive-integer) integer)
;;;                 ((y positive-integer) integer))

     :DOCUMENTATION "* Arguments
- FNAME :: Name of the generic function. Handles names of the form (SETF X)
  correctly.
- GENERIC-ARGLIST :: Follows the same grammar the arglist for [[defun*]]
  forms, except that =&REST, &KEY= and =&OPTIONAL= arguments must be of
  the form:
  : arg =   VARNAME
  :       | (VARNAME TYPE)
- OPTIONS :: Options to DEFGENERIC. Any of these may be simple strings,
  which will be concatenated together and the resulting string treated as
  equivalent to =(:documentation STRING)=.
  One extra option is allowed -- (:layered BOOL). If this is present and BOOL
  is a non-nil constant, the form will generate a ContextL
  `define-layered-function' rather than `defgeneric'.

* Description
Usage is exactly the same as [[defun*]], except that value-checking assertions
are ignored.

If you define any methods inside the form using `:method' clauses, they can
use [[defmethod*]]-style argument lists, :pre and :post clauses, and so on.

Note that you can declare types for arguments in the generic function
argument list. Be careful that these do not clash with method definitions.
Type declarations for generic function arguments will only be used to
make a toplevel =DECLAIM= form that will then apply to all methods of
the generic function.

* Examples:
;;; (defgeneric* (length -> integer) (seq &key start)
;;;    \"Return the length of the sequence SEQ.\"
;;;    ...options...)
;;;
;;; (defgeneric* (length -> integer) ((seq sequence) &key (start integer))
;;;    ...options...)

- BODY :: The body of the form (implicit =progn=).
* Description
Behaves like LET*, but:
- When types are given between the variable name and expression, these
  are converted to declarations within the scope of the LET form.
- When the form to be bound is a list or cons cell, behaves like
  DESTRUCTURING-BIND.
- When the form to be bound is a list whose first element is :values,
  behaves like MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND, using the rest of the elements in
  the form as the variables to be bound. Those elements may be symbols,
  or lists of the form (SYMBOL TYPE), in which case the bound symbol will
  be declared to be of the given type.
- Any variables whose names are '_', either bare or inside a form to be
  destructured, will be renamed with unique symbols and declared 'ignored'
  within the body. This provides a quick way to ignore arguments or parts
  of arguments.

;;; (*let ((name \"Bob\")

     "Identical to *LET, but recursion can occur by calling (NAME ARGS...)

The same as Scheme's named LET. Note that the macro does NOT perform tail
call optimisation. (All modern lisp compilers will perform TCO of the generated
code however.)
